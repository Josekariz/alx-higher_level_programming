# Python Scripts

This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate various concepts and tasks. Below is a description of each script:

## 0. Run Python file
This script is a shell script that runs a Python file. The Python file name is saved in the environment variable `$PYFILE`.

## 1. Run inline
This script is a shell script that runs Python code. The Python code is saved in the environment variable `$PYCODE`.

## 2. Print a string
This Python script prints the message "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle" followed by a new line.

## 3. Print an integer
This Python script prints an integer stored in the variable `number`, followed by the string " Battery street", and a new line. The variable `number` is not cast into a string.

## 4. Print a float
This Python script prints a float stored in the variable `number` with a precision of 2 digits, followed by a new line.

## 5. Print a string multiple times
This Python script prints the value of a string variable `str` three times, followed by the first 9 characters of the string, each on a new line.

## 6. Play with strings
This Python script prints a specific sentence using variables `str1` and `str2`.

## 7. Copy - Cut - Paste
This Python script manipulates a given string `word` to create three new strings: `word_first_3` containing the first 3 letters of `word`, `word_last_2` containing the last 2 letters of `word`, and `middle_word` containing `word` without the first and last letters.

## 8. Create a new sentence
This Python script prints the sentence "object-oriented programming with Python", followed by a new line.

## 9. Easter Egg
This Python script prints "The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters, followed by a new line.

# Technical Interview Preparation

## 10. Linked list cycle (C)
This C program checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it. It defines a function `check_cycle` that takes a linked list as input and returns 1 if there is a cycle and 0 if there is no cycle. The function implements an algorithm to detect cycles in a linked list.

Note: Additional technical interview preparation tasks are available in this repository. They focus on efficient problem-solving and may include checks for runtime and memory usage.

## Requirements

- Python scripts should be run using `python3` (version 3.8.5) on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- Shell scripts should be run on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- C scripts will be compiled using gcc on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, with specific compiler options and style requirements.
- All files should end with a new line.
- Scripts should have the appropriate shebang line as the first line of the file.
- Code should adhere to the specified style guidelines (pycodestyle for Python scripts and Betty style for C scripts).
- Files must be executable.
- Length and formatting requirements are enforced.
- Follow the given instructions for each task.
- Respect copyright and avoid plagiarism.

Please refer to the individual scripts for more details on their functionalities and requirements.
