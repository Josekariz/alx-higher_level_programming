## List of Functions

1. `print_list_integer(my_list=[])`: This function takes a list of integers as input and prints each integer on a separate line.

2. `element_at(my_list, idx)`: This function retrieves an element from a list at the specified index. If the index is negative or out of range, it returns None.

3. `replace_in_list(my_list, idx, element)`: This function replaces an element in a list at a specific position. If the index is negative or out of range, it does not modify anything and returns the original list.

4. `print_reversed_list_integer(my_list=[])`: This function prints all integers in a list in reverse order, with each integer on a separate line.

5. `new_in_list(my_list, idx, element)`: This function replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list. If the index is negative or out of range, it returns a copy of the original list.

6. `no_c(my_string)`: This function removes all occurrences of the characters 'c' and 'C' from a given string and returns the modified string.

7. `print_matrix_integer(matrix=[[]])`: This function prints a matrix of integers. The matrix is represented as a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of the matrix.

8. `add_tuple(tuple_a=(), tuple_b=())`: This function adds two tuples element-wise and returns a new tuple. If a tuple is smaller than 2 elements, it uses 0 for the missing elements. If a tuple is larger than 2 elements, it considers only the first 2 elements.

9. `multiple_returns(sentence)`: This function takes a sentence as input and returns a tuple containing the length of the sentence and its first character. If the sentence is empty, the first character is set to None.

10. `max_integer(my_list=[])`: This function finds the biggest integer in a list and returns it. If the list is empty, it returns None.

11. `divisible_by_2(my_list=[])`: This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with True or False, depending on whether each integer in the original list is divisible by 2.

12. `delete_at(my_list=[], idx=0)`: This function deletes the item at a specific position in a list. If the index is negative or out of range, the list remains unchanged.

13. `switch(a, b)`: This function is left as a placeholder for you to complete. It should switch the values of variables `a` and `b` in the provided source code.

## Implementation Notes

- Each function is implemented according to the provided prototypes and requirements.
- No additional modules are imported for any of the functions.
- Certain constraints and conditions are handled as specified in the requirements.
- The code is written in Python, except for the last function (`switch`), which is left as a placeholder for you to complete in the provided source code.
- The `is_palindrome` function, mentioned in the last item, is not implemented here as it is mentioned to be a C function.
